# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Companion file: see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for agent roles, brand voice rules, and handoff protocols.

---

## 1. Quick Reference

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Next.js linting
```

Path alias: `@/*` maps to project root (configured in `tsconfig.json`).

Package manager: **npm** (lockfile-pinned). The workspace convention is pnpm; this project predates that and stays on npm.

---

## 2. Project Context

This repository hosts the public marketing site for **Pixdyne** — a Melbourne-based IT services company — served at https://pixdyne.com.

The site exists to:

- Establish credibility for Pixdyne as a long-term technology partner for Melbourne SMBs.
- Surface the three service lines and one product line in a way that reads as honest and grounded, not boastful.
- Drive contact form submissions and inbound enquiries.

This is **not** a generic agency template. Every section serves the brand positioning in Section 3.

---

## 3. Brand Positioning

Pixdyne is a Melbourne-based IT services company that has operated since **2018**. Pixdyne positions itself as a **long-term technology partner**, not a one-off vendor.

**One-line summary** (use as the anchor for all copy):

> Pixdyne is a Melbourne-based long-term technology partner. Since 2018, we have grown alongside our clients — delivering web, custom systems, and ongoing operations, and bringing real AI capability into their businesses.

**Differentiation anchors:**

1. **Long-term partnership over one-off delivery.** We embed in our clients' business lines and grow with them.
2. **Proven evolution.** From WordPress and Shopify projects, to NetSuite deployments, to bespoke CRM systems and beyond.
3. **AI capability for our clients, not just for ourselves.** Our product OnlyPixAI is the public proof — we deliver AI products that end users actually touch.

**AI positioning (CRITICAL — easy to get wrong):**

- ❌ Do **not** write copy that says "we use AI to code faster", "AI-assisted development", "vibe-coding", or anything framing AI as our internal productivity tool.
- ✅ Do write copy that frames AI as a **deliverable for the client**: "We bring AI into your business," "AI capability your team can actually use."
- OnlyPixAI ([onlypixai.com](https://www.onlypixai.com/)) is the public proof of this positioning.

---

## 4. Target Audience

Primary audience: **Melbourne SMB decision-makers** — founders, ops managers, marketing leads at companies with roughly 5–200 staff.

Audience traits:

- Cost-aware but not cheap-seeking. Looking for trustworthy, long-term value.
- Often burned by previous vendors who built and left.
- Prefer a local team they can call, not an offshore agency.
- Sceptical of jargon and inflated metrics.

**Voice implications:**

- Plain, confident English. Not buzzword-heavy.
- Concrete examples and timelines over vague superlatives.
- Local reference points where genuinely useful (Melbourne, Victoria).
- Never inflate scale or claim experience we cannot back up.

## 5. Service Architecture

```
Pixdyne services

    └── DevOps             Ongoing iteration, bug fixes, integrations, feature work.
                             (no standalone page — lives inside the Operations bundle page only)

Product line
└── OnlyPixAI              https://www.onlypixai.com/ — Pixdyne's own AI product.
                            → /services/onlypixai
                            Demonstrates our capability to deliver AI to end users.
```

**Naming is fixed.** Do not rename services, do not introduce new top-level service lines without explicit owner approval.

**Operations** is sold à la carte (single service) or as a bundled retainer. As of 2026-05-25 its two most client-legible lines — **Managed IT** and **SEO & Content** — each have a **standalone service detail page** (own slug, metadata, and `Service`/`FAQPage` schema), while the `/services/operations` bundle page is retained as the packaged overview (and still hosts DevOps). The homepage Capabilities rail and the desktop nav Services dropdown both surface exactly these four lines: Web Development · System Development · Managed IT · SEO & Content (OnlyPixAI and the Operations bundle page are deliberately excluded from both). See §13 (2026-05-25).

## 6. Content Constraints (HARD RULES)

These rules override any default agent behaviour. Violating them is a blocking quality issue.

| # | Rule | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Never publish team member names, photos, bios, or LinkedIn handles. | Owner has chosen not to expose individual identities; involves client and partner relationships. |
| 2 | Never publish specific client names or logos unless the owner has explicitly approved that client for publication in this session. | Client confidentiality. |
| 3 | Never invent delivery metrics (e.g. "150+ projects", "99% satisfaction", "24/7 support"). Use placeholders such as `<!-- TBD: real metrics from owner -->` instead. | Inflated stats erode trust and breach E-E-A-T. |
| 4 | Company history anchor is **2018**. Never imply earlier founding. | Factual constraint. |
| 5 | Service names are fixed: Web Development / System Development / Operations / OnlyPixAI, plus the two Operations lines that now have their own detail pages — Managed IT and SEO & Content. Do not paraphrase or rename. Do not split a service into new standalone pages without explicit owner approval (the Managed IT / SEO & Content split was approved 2026-05-25 — see §13). | Brand consistency. |
| 6 | Geographic anchor is **Melbourne, Victoria, Australia**. Use local context where genuinely relevant. | Local SEO and customer fit. |
| 7 | AI positioning: AI is a capability we deliver to clients, not a tool we use internally for coding. Reject any copy that frames AI as our internal accelerator. | See Section 3. |
| 8 | When real content is missing, leave a visible placeholder (`<!-- TBD: ... -->` in code, "Coming soon" in UI) rather than fabricating. | Truthfulness. |
| 9 | **Audience framing.** Do not segment downward in user-facing copy. Banned: "for SMBs", "small business", "small and medium businesses", "Melbourne SMBs", any phrasing that targets by company size. Audience targeting (Melbourne SMBs) is internal positioning only — see Section 4. Use growth-narrative framing instead: "businesses we partner with", "ambitious teams", "growing companies", "from idea to operating system". Local presence ("Melbourne", "Australian") is fine when it serves proximity / accessibility, never size. | Stating "we serve small businesses" reads as a low-confidence positioning. The brand goal is partnership and growth, not segmentation by client size. |
| 10 | **Technical vocabulary in user-facing copy.** Default to vocabulary a non-technical business owner recognises. Use: WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Squarespace, NetSuite, Salesforce, HubSpot, ERP, CRM, Node.js, iOS, Android, hosting, monitoring, SEO, analytics. Avoid (in user-facing copy): Next.js, React, Tailwind, GSAP, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Sentry, Vercel, Cloudflare. Engineer-level vocabulary is fine in CLAUDE.md, code comments, and internal documentation. | Decision-makers shop on names they know. Engineer-only stack names register as noise to the audience. |
| 11 | **Template boilerplate residue.** This codebase started from an agency template that ships pre-populated with US-coded placeholders. Audit and remove every variant of (a)–(f) before any commit, and treat the canonical answer column as the only acceptable replacement. | Boilerplate residue looks plausible and ship-ready, which is exactly why it causes the most damage when wrong. Several variants were only caught after live preview during the May 2026 audit. |

#### Rule 11 detail — canonical replacements

| Pattern (banned) | Canonical replacement |
|------------------|----------------------|
| (a) Fake office / city tags ("SFO · NYC · LND", "Offices in N cities") | "Melbourne · Australia". Pixdyne is single-location. |
| (b) US legal entity suffixes ("Inc.", "LLC") | "Pixdyne · ABN 96 690 116 584". Pixdyne has no US incorporation. |
| (c) Non-Australian governing law in legal pages (e.g. California, Delaware, England & Wales) | State of Victoria, Australia, with non-exclusive jurisdiction in Victorian courts. |
| (d) Hardcoded copyright years (`© 2024`, `© 2025`) | `© {new Date().getFullYear()}`. Auto-updating, never rots. |
| (e) Multiple departmental email addresses (`privacy@`, `legal@`, `hello@`, `support@`) | Only `info@pixdyne.com` is published. Do not invent mailboxes. |
| (f) Fabricated industry coverage ("trusted by industry leaders across finance, tech, and healthcare") | Either omit, or describe what we actually deliver in plain prose. See rule 8 (placeholders preferred over fabrications). |

**Visible placeholders are preferred over fabricated content.** They are a feature, not a bug — they signal to the owner what still needs filling.

## 7. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | React Server Components available. |
| UI runtime | React 19 | Many sections currently `'use client'`. Review before adding more. |
| Language | TypeScript 5.8 | Strict mode in `tsconfig.json`. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 | Brand tokens defined via `@theme` block in `app/globals.css`. Do not redefine brand tokens elsewhere. |
| Animation | GSAP 3 + `@gsap/react` + ScrollTrigger | Primary engine. `motion` is also installed but should not be expanded — consolidate on GSAP. |
| 3D / WebGL | `ogl` | Currently unused or near-unused — flag for removal if not needed. |
| Icons | `lucide-react` | |
| Component utilities | shadcn/ui (`new-york`), `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` | |
| Package manager | npm | Workspace convention is pnpm; this project stays on npm. |
| Deployment | Vercel | Region: `syd1`. |

---

## 8. Visual System

**Palette** (defined in `app/globals.css` `@theme` block; JS mirrors in `lib/brand.ts`):

- Brand yellow / dark gold: `#C8962A` — primary accent (warm gold, not generic yellow)
- Brand black: `#0B0A08` — warm near-black
- Brand surface: `#151311`
- Brand white: `#F5F2ED` — warm off-white
- Brand text: `#E8E4DD` — warm cream
- Brand muted: `#8A847B`
- Brand yellow deep: `#8A6510` — accent text on **light** surfaces only (brand yellow is 2.4:1 on brand white and fails WCAG; this clears 4.5:1)

**Typography:**

- `Playfair Display` — display / headings (serif, often italic)
- `Space Grotesk` — body / UI (sans-serif)

**Animation language:**

- StickySection layered scroll with explicit z-index ordering (10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 45, 48, 50).
- Transition types: `curtain`, `parallax`, `mask-diagonal`, `pixel-glitch`, `none`.
- Services section uses GSAP horizontal pin + snap (intentional break from the vertical sticky pattern).
- Hero uses character-level GSAP stagger.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected globally. Keep it that way.

**Style direction:**

Warm dark editorial — gold-on-warm-black with serif italic headlines. **Avoid template-y agency styling** (centred hero with gradient blob, three-column "services" grid, generic gradients). Maintain the existing intentional layering and rhythm.

---

## 9. Sticky Scroll System

The homepage uses a stacked sticky section architecture. Each `StickySection` applies `position: sticky; top: 0` with explicit z-index ordering, so sections layer on top of each other as the user scrolls.

- `StickySection` (`components/layout/StickySection.tsx`): wrapper with z-index, transition type, `fitContent` flag, optional peek background.
- Each section component in `components/sections/` is self-contained.
- Z-index values must increment to maintain correct layering (current scheme: 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 45, 48, 50).
- The `ServicesSection` is **not** wrapped in `StickySection` — it manages its own GSAP `ScrollTrigger` pin.

---

## 10. Information Architecture

Current routes:

```
/                        Homepage (sticky-scroll, no contact section)
/about                   About page
/services                Services index — "Melbourne IT services" hub (live)
/services/[slug]         Service detail (dynamic)
/work                    Case studies index
/work/[slug]             Case study detail
/blog                    Blog index
/blog/[slug]             Blog post
/contact                 Contact form + Pixdyne contact details
/free-seo-audit          Free SEO/GEO audit tool
/legal/privacy
/legal/terms
/offline                 Service-worker offline fallback (noindex, not in sitemap)

App store-compliance surfaces (see §15) — reachable, but absent from
navigation and sitemap:
/apps                    App policy + support hub (noindex, follow)
/pixcomic/privacy        PixComic privacy policy
/pixcomic/support        PixComic support FAQ
/haoroomie/privacy       Hao Roomie privacy policy
/haoroomie/support       Hao Roomie support FAQ

/api/contact             Contact form endpoint
/api/seo-audit           Audit crawler (+ /report-pdf)
/api/blog-image          Generated in-article pull-quote images
/llms.txt, /robots.ts, /sitemap.ts, /manifest.ts
```

**Component organisation:**

- `components/layout/` — layout primitives (Navigation, StickySection)
- `components/sections/` — full-page sections (Hero, Services, Team, etc.)
- `components/*.tsx` (root) — visual / interactive primitives, several from React Bits registry: Aurora, BlurText, DecryptedText, Masonry, MasonryCard, ProfileCard, SplitText, TiltedCard, BentoCard, SpotlightCard, LogoLoop, CountUp, AnimatedContent. Audit usage before adding more.

**Data layer** in `lib/data/`:

- `services.ts` — service offerings (currently misaligned with Section 5; pending rewrite)
- `case-studies.ts` — portfolio items (placeholder content; pending owner-provided list)
- `team.ts` — team members (must be emptied or replaced with anonymised content per Section 6)
- `blog.ts` — blog posts (placeholder content; pending blog content plan)

Centralised types live in `types/index.ts`.

**Pending decisions** (do not implement until explicitly confirmed):

- `<!-- TBD: top navigation menu items — owner has not finalised -->`
- `<!-- TBD: OnlyPixAI presentation on homepage (section vs. dedicated page) — owner has not finalised -->`
- `<!-- TBD: Sanity CMS integration — workspace convention is to share Sanity studio at pixdyne-dashboard, currently not wired up here -->`

> `/about` is now live (route shipped, in sitemap, renders `AboutSection`). No longer pending — content may still evolve, but the route is confirmed. See §13 (2026-05-25).

---

## 11. SEO Baseline

**Currently in place:**

- `metadataBase`, per-page canonical, Open Graph, Twitter card
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` routes (dynamic + static)
- JSON-LD, **server-rendered into static HTML** via plain `<script type="application/ld+json">` in Server Components (NOT client-injected via `next/script` — so non-JS AI crawlers like GPTBot/PerplexityBot/ClaudeBot read it from the raw HTML): `ProfessionalService` (root, covers `LocalBusiness` subtype with full address + ABN + areaServed Melbourne/VIC/AU), `WebSite`, `Service`, `FAQPage`, `CreativeWork`, `Article`, `BreadcrumbList`. **Never re-introduce `next/script` `<Script>` for JSON-LD — it injects client-side and is invisible to non-JS crawlers (see §13, 2026-05-25).**
- Skip-to-main-content link, `prefers-reduced-motion`, focus-visible outlines
- Australian English copy, AU locale OG, `en_AU` declared

**Remaining gaps** (these are real, not placeholders):

- Google Search Console ownership is verified via a DNS `google-site-verification` TXT record (Domain property, apex + www). `verification.google` in `app/layout.tsx` is therefore intentionally absent — do not add a meta tag. Remaining owner-side action: submit sitemap + request homepage reindex in GSC.
- Per-service 1200×630 landscape OG images are not produced. Service detail pages fall back to the 1080×1080 square. Once landscape variants exist, upgrade Twitter card to `summary_large_image` per service.
- `sameAs` now carries the verified Google Business Profile URL (added 2026-06-18). X / LinkedIn remain absent — confirmed not to exist as of 2026-06-18; add only once the handles are created and verified.
- Google Business Profile is claimed (2026-06-18). `geo`, `openingHoursSpecification` (Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00), and `legalName` (Pixdyne Pty Ltd) are now emitted in `ProfessionalService` schema, all sourced from `lib/data/business.ts`. See §14.9 and §13 (2026-06-18).
- `AggregateRating` is intentionally absent. Do not add until at least 5 verifiable reviews exist.

(FAQ content now exists for all four services and `FAQPage` is emitted server-side where present — `generateFAQSchema` returns `null` for empty arrays, so no empty stub ships.)

**Phase 2 SEO scope** (active): Melbourne local SEO citations, GEO (generative engine optimisation), Google Business Profile claim, blog content programme. Governance rules in §14.

---

## 12. Workflow

For any non-trivial change, follow this protocol:

1. **Plan first.** Restate the change, identify affected files, surface risks. Defer to the owner before touching code if the change spans multiple sections or is content-heavy.
2. **Respect content constraints.** See Section 6.
3. **Use the right agent.** See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). Content goes through `content-agent`. SEO and schema work goes through `seo-agent`. Code goes through `frontend-agent`. Every commit must pass `truth-auditor` review.
4. **Conventional Commits.** Follow the format in workspace `CLAUDE.md`.
5. **Build and lint must pass** before any commit.

## 13. Decisions Log

> Append decisions here as they are made. Remove obsolete entries when superseded.

- **2026-05-08** — Brand positioning, target audience, service architecture, and content constraints established (this document).
- **2026-05-08** — Truth Auditor agent role accepted.
- **2026-05-08** — Team identities, client names, and partner names: not to be published.
- **2026-05-08** — AI positioning anchored as "capability for clients", not "internal coding tool". OnlyPixAI is the public proof.
- **2026-05-08** — Added Section 6 rules 9 (audience framing — never target downward by size in copy) and 10 (technical vocabulary — business-owner names only in user-facing copy).
- **2026-05-08** — Office address: **294 Clayton Rd, Clayton VIC 3169** (replaces previous Truganina address).
- **2026-05-08** — OnlyPixAI confirmed as a Unified AI API Gateway product. To be presented as the flagship product on the homepage in a dedicated section, placed mid-flow (not above the fold).
- **2026-05-08** — Case study taxonomy direction: e-commerce sites, company / marketing sites, internal systems. Specific cases pending owner list.
- **2026-05-09** — Added Section 6 rule 11 (template boilerplate residue audit) after live preview surfaced six categories of US-coded placeholders (fake offices "SFO · NYC · LND", "Pixdyne Inc." entity suffix, California governing law, hardcoded © 2024, fake departmental emails like privacy@ / legal@, fabricated "trusted by industry leaders" claims). Canonical replacements documented in rule 11 detail table.
- **2026-05-09** — Published business identity: **Pixdyne · ABN 96 690 116 584**. Single contact email: **info@pixdyne.com**. Locality anchor: **Melbourne · Australia**. Governing law: **State of Victoria**. These are the only acceptable values for the corresponding surfaces.
- **2026-05-10** — Canonical brand spellings (recorded after the `pxidyne` typo reached commit c8a0d16 in a directory name, code comment, and commit message before the owner caught it). Verify the exact spelling on every new path, filename, identifier, or copy string before commit: **Pixdyne** (P-I-X-D-Y-N-E, six letters; not "Pxidyne", "Pixdync", "Pixdyn"); **OnlyPixAI** (single word, capital P, capital A, capital I; not "Only Pix AI", "OnlyPixAi", "OnlyPxAI"). When introducing user-supplied terms, repeat them back before persisting if there is any chance of misspelling.
- **TBD** — Top navigation menu structure.
- **TBD** — Owner-provided historical project list per category.
- **TBD** — Verified social handles for `sameAs` schema. @pixdyne (X) and linkedin.com/company/pixdyne confirmed NOT to exist as of 2026-06-18; add only once created. GBP URL is already in `sameAs`.
- **2026-05-13** — SEO governance formalised in Section 14. Section 11 refreshed to current state (most of the previously-listed "known issues" were already resolved between 2026-05-08 and 2026-05-10). Long-term rules now cover NAP consistency, per-page metadata template, mandatory schema coverage by route, URL conventions, heading hierarchy, image SEO, keyword framework (target-customer aligned), performance budgets, local SEO checklist, GEO rules, blog content production, and audit cadence.
- **2026-05-13** — Contact promoted from homepage sticky section to standalone `/contact` route. Driven by the new sitewide SiteFooter (which now owns NAP + legal links + copyright), making the homepage's `<ContactSection />` a duplication. All CTAs and nav links migrated from `#contact` / `/#contact` to `/contact`. ContactSection's own bottom legal/copyright strip removed — that responsibility now lives in SiteFooter only.
- **2026-05-13** — Contact form wired to Resend. Notification email lands at info@pixdyne.com with `From: Pixdyne Contact <support@mail.pixdyne.com>` and `Reply-To` set to the form submitter so Gmail "Reply" goes directly to the lead. IP-granular sliding-window rate limit (5 requests / 10 min per IP) in `lib/rate-limit.ts` gates the route before the body is even parsed. In-memory `Map`, fine for low-traffic marketing site; swap for Upstash Redis if multi-instance state matters later.
- **2026-05-13** — NAP single source of truth tightened. New `lib/data/business.ts` holds `BUSINESS` + `BUSINESS_FORMATTED`; schema.ts, both legal pages, SiteFooter, and ContactSection all import from there instead of hardcoding literals. Phone number (+61 410 510 751) added to the NAP contract — previously it was floating in two surfaces with no governance. §14.1 rewritten: any address/email/phone/ABN literal anywhere outside the constants file is now a truth-auditor block. §14.2 clarified to recognise file-based `opengraph-image.tsx` as the OG image source (Next.js auto-merges). Hero sr-only GEO prose adjusted: "businesses across Australia" → "businesses in Melbourne and across Australia" to keep the Melbourne anchor explicit. Service detail FAQ accordion: stable key + WebKit details-marker suppression for older iOS Safari. Root `opengraph-image.tsx` dropped `runtime = 'edge'` to align with the per-service generator (Vercel current guidance prefers Fluid Compute).
- **2026-05-25** — SEO/GEO audit fixes shipped (commit `76acfd5`) and verified live. (1) **JSON-LD delivery fixed** — every route was injecting structured data client-side via `next/script` `<Script>`, leaving zero `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags in the server HTML (invisible to non-JS AI crawlers — the exact GEO audience). Converted all of `app/layout.tsx` + the 7 page files to plain `<script>` in Server Components. Verified in production: home (ProfessionalService + WebSite), `/services/[slug]` (+ Service + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage), `/work/[slug]` (+ CreativeWork + BreadcrumbList), `/blog/[slug]` (+ Article + BreadcrumbList), `/about` & `/contact` (+ BreadcrumbList). §11 corrected accordingly — schema had been listed as "in place" but was client-injected. (2) **Domain canonicalisation fixed** — Vercel primary domain flipped to apex `pixdyne.com`; `www.pixdyne.com` now **308**-redirects to apex (previously apex → www via **307**), aligning the served host with canonical tags, sitemap, and robots `Host`. (3) **Home keyword** — title changed `Pixdyne | Digital Alchemy` → `Pixdyne | Melbourne Technology Partner` (§14.2 primary cluster in title); hero kicker now surfaces "Melbourne Technology Partner" at first paint (§14.5/§14.10) while keeping the Digital Alchemy tagline and Est. 2018. (4) Doc drift reconciled: `/about` confirmed live (removed from §10 pending); FAQ content now exists for all four services and FAQPage ships (removed from §11 gaps).
- **2026-05-25** — Blog hardening + service-line split. (1) **Blog (3 placeholder posts) rewritten to comply** — removed engineer-only stack names from user-facing copy (§6 rule 10 / §14.7): renamed slug `nextjs-performance-optimization` → `why-your-website-is-slow` (301 in `next.config.ts`), reframed "Next.js / React Server Components / RAG / vector DB" into business-owner vocabulary; added Melbourne anchors, answer-first ledes (GEO), one service internal link per post, current dates, and ISO `datePublished` for valid `Article` schema. (2) **Title double-suffix fixed** — `seoTitle`/index titles had a hardcoded `| Pixdyne` that the root layout `title.template` (`%s | Pixdyne`) then appended again (`… | Pixdyne | Pixdyne`); stripped so the template owns branding. (3) **OG image gaps fixed** — blog `/og/blog/{slug}.jpg` 404'd while declaring `summary_large_image`; `/about` and `/contact` declared the large card with no image at all (the root file-based `opengraph-image` does NOT propagate to nested routes). All three now reference the 1200×630 `/opengraph-image` route explicitly. (4) **Operations split into standalone pages** — owner-approved: **Managed IT** (`/services/managed-it`) and **SEO & Content** (`/services/seo-content`) are now standalone service detail pages (full `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` + `FAQPage` schema), while `/services/operations` is retained as the bundle page (still hosts DevOps, and now links out to the two standalone lines via `SubService.detailHref`). The homepage Capabilities rail (`getCapabilityCards`) and the desktop nav Services dropdown were aligned to surface exactly these four lines — Web Development · System Development · Managed IT · SEO & Content — dropping OnlyPixAI and the Operations bundle from both. SiteFooter now deep-links all six service pages. §5 and §6 rule 5 updated accordingly.
- **2026-06-13** — `llms.txt` shipped (`app/llms.txt/route.ts`, statically prerendered, llmstxt.org format). GEO surface: answer-first company summary + service/product/company link lists. All copy is sourced from the canonical data layer (`lib/data/services.ts` descriptions, `lib/data/business.ts` NAP) — never hand-edit facts into the route file; edit the data layer instead. Same-day audit confirmed all 2026-05-25 fixes live in production. GSC ownership is verified at the **DNS layer** (a `google-site-verification=…` TXT record on `pixdyne.com`, covering the apex + www "Domain" property) — so `verification.google` in `app/layout.tsx` is intentionally absent; the DNS record is the single source of truth, do not add a meta tag. Remaining indexing action is owner-side only: in GSC, submit the sitemap and request reindex of the homepage so the stale pre-2026-05-25 title ("Digital Alchemy") and old `www` host drop out of the search index.
- **2026-06-18** — Work catalogue + local-SEO/GEO pass. (1) **Two case studies added** — Lexcord Lawyers (`/work/lexcord`, bilingual Melbourne law firm, live URL `lexcord.com.au`) and AS Academy (`/work/as-academy`, bilingual youth-education on a `.cn` domain, `asacademy.com.cn`). Both Web Development only. Screenshots captured to `public/projects/`. (2) **`/work` ordering** is owner-curated via raw array order in `lib/data/case-studies.ts` (the page uses `getAllCaseStudies()`, NOT featured-first; `getFeaturedCaseStudies`/`getCaseStudiesFeaturedFirst` are currently unused). Current front order: 4WD Interiors · Austin Education · Gameology · Goodmood Studio · Insight Idea · Open Mat · Cupcake Central · WinCareer, then the rest. Inter-entry category comments were dropped since order no longer follows category. (3) **Online Education** client renamed to **To Future**. (4) **Google Business Profile claimed**; registered legal entity confirmed as **Pixdyne Pty Ltd**. Schema upgrades in `lib/seo/schema.ts` (all values sourced from `lib/data/business.ts`): `legalName`, `sameAs` (GBP share URL), `geo` (-37.9254886, 145.119953), `openingHoursSpecification` (Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00), plus `areaServed` Clayton + service-level Australia, CreativeWork `url`/ISO `dateCreated`. (5) **Schema/SEO fixes**: `<html lang>` `en` → `en-AU`; service-detail breadcrumb `/#services` → `/services`; added `BreadcrumbList` to `/work`, `CollectionPage`+`ItemList`+`BreadcrumbList` to `/blog`, `AboutPage` to `/about`. `aggregateRating` still withheld (owner: hold until 5+ reviews). X/LinkedIn `sameAs` withheld (handles do not exist yet).
- **2026-06-22** — **Free SEO/GEO Audit tool merged into the site** at `/free-seo-audit` (previously a separately-deployed app, repo `pixdyne-seo-geo-audit`). The site's first interactive tool. The tool was already built in the Pixdyne brand (byte-identical gold/black palette + Playfair Display / Space Grotesk), so this was a port, not a redesign — the ported components keep their inline-style hex values, which intentionally equal the brand tokens (NOT Tailwind classes; do not "fix" them to Tailwind). Two non-token colours are deliberate exceptions: `#B7B0A6` (lighter body grey, more readable than `--color-brand-muted`) and `#1E1B18` (SpotlightCard surface). Added: `app/free-seo-audit/` (server `page.tsx` with metadata + `BreadcrumbList` schema wrapping a `'use client'` `SeoAuditClient`), `components/seo-audit/*` (Landing/Scanning/Report/DimensionDetail/SpotlightCard), `lib/seo-audit/*` (types + `@react-pdf` `ReportPdf`), and API routes `app/api/seo-audit/route.ts` (1027-line deterministic crawler+scorer, streaming NDJSON via `?stream=1`) + `app/api/seo-audit/report-pdf/route.ts` (PDF export). The tool's own Nav/Footer were dropped for the global `Navigation`/`SiteFooter`; localStorage screen-persistence removed so the server render is always the Landing hero. `app/globals.css` gained `--font-sans`/`--font-serif`/`--font-mono` aliases (the site had no `--font-mono`) + the `sg*` keyframes. `next.config.ts` gained `serverExternalPackages: ['@react-pdf/renderer']` (required — fontkit can't be webpack-bundled). Both API routes run on the Node runtime and are IP rate-limited via `lib/rate-limit.ts` (audit 5 / 10 min, PDF 10 / 10 min). Lead capture (email gate before PDF download) reuses the existing Resend integration to notify `info@pixdyne.com` — no CRM webhook (`LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL` left optional/unset). New optional env (documented in `.env.example`): `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` (real LCP/INP/CLS; degrades to an HTML-size proxy when unset) and `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL`. Entry point is footer-only (added to `SiteFooter` SERVICE_LINKS); route added to `sitemap.ts`. Verified live: `tsc`/build green, real streaming audit + valid PDF + 429 rate-limit all confirmed.
- **2026-06-23** — **Free SEO Audit — signal-depth upgrade** (research-led, `app/api/seo-audit/route.ts` only; no UI changes — the report renders checks dynamically). Added deterministic 2026 AI/Google signals the first cut missed, sourced from current GEO/SEO research: (1) **CDN/WAF AI-crawler reachability probe** — fetches the homepage as `OAI-SearchBot` and flags a 401/403/429/503 block even when robots.txt allows it (the single most damaging, least-visible AI issue; robots-only checks can't see it). (2) **Bingbot crawlability** (Bing powers Copilot + ChatGPT retrieval). (3) **AI self-harm meta directives** — `nosnippet`/`max-snippet:0`/`noai`/`noimageai`. (4) **Content freshness** — newest `datePublished`/`dateModified` across pages (recency is a strong AI-citation signal; framed not to reward timestamp-gaming). (5) **Canonical mismatch** (points elsewhere, not just missing). (6) **Thin content** (<200 words). (7) **Open Graph/Twitter** presence. (8) **`<html lang>`**. (9) **Citable signals** (statistics/quotes/outbound-citation density — Princeton GEO). Honesty correction: **`llms.txt` no longer penalised** (2026 research: Google ignores it; mainly Perplexity/IDE agents) — reported, not scored. 10 new fix-library entries. Verified live on a content-rich site (vercel.com SEO 77/GEO 68) and a sparse one (example.com) — both positive and negative branches fire correctly; `tsc`/build green.
- **2026-06-23** — **Free SEO Audit — de-wheel-reinvention pass** (replaced hand-rolled code with mature libraries). (1) **Sitemap parsing** in `app/api/seo-audit/route.ts` moved off regex onto **`fast-xml-parser`** + `node:zlib` gunzip — the old `matchAll(/<loc>/)` silently returned zero URLs for gzipped (`.xml.gz`) or CDATA-wrapped sitemaps (a real coverage bug, not just style); now handles gzip, sitemap-index, namespaced/CDATA `<loc>`. (2) **Request validation** now uses **Zod** (`lib/seo-audit/schema.ts`) on all three API routes — `/api/seo-audit` (domain), `/api/seo-audit/report-pdf` (full `AuditData` body, previously only spot-checked before reaching @react-pdf), and `/api/contact` (replaced the hand-rolled email regex + length checks). Satisfies the workspace coding-style "validate at boundaries with Zod" rule (Zod was not previously installed anywhere). (3) **Report score rings + count-up** (`components/seo-audit/Report.tsx`) moved off a hand-rolled `setInterval` easing loop onto **GSAP** (`useGSAP`, the project's standard engine per §7) — single RAF tween, auto-revert on unmount, and now honours `prefers-reduced-motion` (the old loop ignored it). New deps: `fast-xml-parser`, `zod`. Verified live: sitemap discovery still finds 20 pages on vercel.com, Zod returns 400 on bad input + 200 PDF on valid, GSAP rings animate with zero console errors; `tsc`/build green.
- **2026-06-24** — **Free SEO Audit — abuse/security hardening.** The audit endpoint fetches arbitrary user-supplied URLs server-side, so it was a sensitive surface. Fixed: (1) **SSRF guard** (`lib/seo-audit/ssrf.ts`, uses `ipaddr.js` + `node:dns`): resolves the target host and rejects any non-public address — loopback, private (10/172.16/192.168), link-local incl. **169.254.169.254 cloud-metadata**, unique-local, reserved, CGNAT, plus `localhost`/`.local`/`.internal`/`metadata.google.internal` and non-http(s) schemes. Enforced both as a GET pre-check and inside `fetchRaw`, so **every redirect hop and sub-resource is re-checked** (an external site can no longer 302 the crawler to an internal IP). Escape hatch `ALLOW_PRIVATE_AUDIT_TARGETS=1` for local dev. Residual: DNS-rebinding (TOCTOU) is not fully closed — would need connection-time IP pinning. (2) **Rate-limit key was spoofable** — `getClientIp` took the left-most `x-forwarded-for` (client-supplied); now prefers `x-real-ip` (Vercel's true peer IP) with a right-most-XFF fallback. Benefits the contact form too. (3) **report-pdf DoS** — the `AuditData` body (rendered to PDF server-side) is now size-bounded in Zod (dimensions ≤30, checks/fixes ≤40, rows ≤60, string `.max()`s). New dep: `ipaddr.js`. **Still soft / open decision:** the rate limiter remains in-memory per-instance (per CLAUDE.md 2026-05-13) — a durable store (Upstash/Vercel KV) or Vercel Firewall is needed for a hard cross-instance cap; lead-email volume is now bounded by the fixed IP key but not hard-capped. Verified live: localhost/127.0.0.1/169.254.169.254/10.0.0.1 → 400; public sites unaffected; oversized PDF payload → 400; `tsc`/build green.
- **2026-06-24** — **Free SEO Audit — Vercel BotID added** (layered bot protection on top of the rate limit). The two audit endpoints are the main scripted-abuse vector (each request = an expensive crawl / PDF), and IP rate limiting can't stop an IP-rotating script — BotID classifies whether the *client* is a real browser. `botid` integration: `withBotId()` wraps `next.config.ts`; `<BotIdClient>` in the root layout `<head>` protects ONLY `/api/seo-audit` (GET) + `/api/seo-audit/report-pdf` (POST) — content pages and all other routes are untouched, so SEO/AI crawlers reading the site are unaffected; both routes call `await checkBotId()` and return 403 when `isBot`. Only effective on Vercel deploys; `checkBotId()` returns a human verdict in local dev (verified: local audit still 200). Basic tier is free; Deep Analysis is a paid add-on. New dep: `botid`.
- **2026-06-24** — **Free SEO Audit — accuracy fixes + placeholder removal** (found by dogfooding the tool on pixdyne.com). (1) Removed the pre-filled `lumen-roasters.com` placeholder domain — the input now starts empty and requires the visitor to enter their own site (empty submit re-focuses the field). (2) **Organization-schema detection** now recognises LocalBusiness/Organization SUBTYPES (`ProfessionalService`, `Store`, `*Business`, …) via `isOrgType`, not just the literal `Organization`/`LocalBusiness` — our own site uses `ProfessionalService` and was being falsely told "no Organization schema". (3) **CSR/extractability detection** now uses an absolute raw-HTML text floor (`textLength < 250`) instead of `textRatio < 0.08`, which falsely flagged animation-/framework-heavy sites (the pixdyne.com homepage server-renders ~6k chars of text at a 0.038 ratio) as "needs JS to render". On pixdyne.com these moved the now-accurate scores SEO 79→83, GEO 73→90 (Structured 72→94, Extractability 36→86, Entity clarity 82→100).
- **2026-06-24** — **Blog voice direction shift + writing references.** Owner called the existing blog too flat (manual-style: define-term → four-bullets → polite close). New direction: a livelier, voice-led style — scene/opinion ledes, a real point of view, dry wit, concrete imagery — while every truthfulness/identity rule stays intact (no fabricated metrics §6 rule 3; no unapproved client/team names §6 rules 1–2; AI positioning §6 rule 7; Melbourne anchor; business-owner vocabulary §6 rule 10; no size segmentation §6 rule 9; AU spelling). (1) **Five blog-writing references added** under `references/` — `voice.md` (anchor thesis: "lively = voice/rhythm/imagery/opinions/stories/wit, NOT exclamation marks and big words"), `humour.md` (dry, on-brand wit; the source humour article's dad-joke register deliberately NOT copied), `opinions.md` (the §14.11 every-post-has-an-angle mandate — state the honest default, then name the exception), `stats.md` (the §6 rule 3 no-invented-metrics discipline; external primary-sourced stats only), `stories.md` (anonymised composites; only owner-approved `lib/data/case-studies.ts` clients may be named). (2) **Exclamation-mark ban lifted** — `AGENTS.md §3.4` changed from "No exclamation marks in body copy" to "allowed, sparingly" (energy from voice/rhythm, not punctuation or hype); a pointer to `references/` added under AGENTS.md §3. (3) **All 12 posts in `lib/data/blog.ts` rewritten** in the new voice — `excerpt` + `content` only; slugs, dates, titles, `seoTitle`, `seoDescription`, and internal-link targets unchanged (SEO-safe, no redirects needed). Verified: `tsc` + `npm run build` green, all 12 blog slugs prerender, banned-word grep clean. Aside: `npm run lint` is separately broken — Next 16 removed the `next lint` subcommand (`next` treats "lint" as a project dir); pre-existing and unrelated, candidate fix is migrating the script to `eslint .`.
- **2026-06-24** — **Blog rendering fix + length expansion + generated brand imagery** (owner feedback after the voice rewrite: formatting wrong, posts too short, no images). (1) **Formatting root cause** — `@tailwindcss/typography` was never installed or registered, so the blog body's `prose` classes (`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`) were inert: `<h2>` rendered at body size and `<ul>` had no bullets. Tailwind 4 registers plugins in CSS, so `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";` was added to `app/globals.css` and the prose palette was brand-tuned (warm body, gold bullets, gold quote borders) via `.prose` CSS variables. (2) **Length** — all 12 posts expanded ~2–3× to match their read-time labels (extra sections, concrete scenarios, honest trade-offs), the livelier voice and every §6/§14 hard rule intact. (3) **Imagery** — per-post generated brand covers via `app/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` (shared renderer `lib/blog/cover-art.tsx`, gold-on-warm-black, `system-ui` to match the existing OG generators) now serve as BOTH the visible article hero and the social card, which closes the §14.13 per-blog OG gap. Each post also carries one in-article pull-quote image generated by `app/api/blog-image/route.tsx` (data-bound by `slug` + `i` index into the new `BlogPost.pullQuotes`; renders only text already in the data layer, so there is no free-text/abuse surface), and the `/blog` index cards gained cover thumbnails. Article schema `image` (`lib/seo/schema.ts`) now points at the per-post cover. New dep: `@tailwindcss/typography` (build-time CSS plugin — no client JS). Verified: `tsc` + `build` green (79 prerendered pages incl. 12 per-post covers), cover + pull-quote endpoints return 200 `image/png`, unknown slug → 404, plus a screenshot visual check.
- **2026-07-10** — **SEO/GEO + accessibility audit fixes.** Full-site audit first (Lighthouse mobile: SEO 100 / Best Practices 100 / A11y 92; all 15 routes 200; www/http → apex 308; OAI-SearchBot/GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot/Bingbot/Googlebot all 200 — no CDN blocking; lab LCP 552ms / CLS 0.00). Fixes shipped: (1) **`/work/[slug]` og:image** — 21 of 31 case studies have `img: ''` and shipped NO og:image while declaring `summary_large_image`; the `generateMetadata` comment wrongly assumed the root file-based opengraph-image propagates to nested routes (it does not — same trap as 2026-05-25 /about + /contact). Now falls back explicitly to the 1200×630 `/opengraph-image` route. (2) **Legal + haoroomie privacy pages** gained full §14.2 `openGraph`/`twitter` blocks (their `og:url` previously fell back to the homepage, mismatching their canonicals). (3) **Service detail heading hierarchy** (§14.5) — h1→h3 skip fixed: section heads h3→h2, sub-service titles h4→h3, sidebar heads h4→h3; visual classes unchanged. (4) **WCAG contrast** — ServicesSection progress label `text-brand-text/30`→`/60`; ProcessSection ghost number `/10`→`/45` (hover `yellow/30`→`yellow/60`) and step desc `/50`→`/60`; BlogSection (light `bg-brand-white`) date/read-time `brand-muted`→`brand-black/70` and category chip `brand-yellow`→new token **`--color-brand-yellow-deep: #8A6510`** (deep gold for light surfaces only, ≥4.5:1 on brand-white; mirrored in `lib/brand.ts`, documented in §8). (5) **WCAG 2.5.3 label-in-name** — ServicesSection CTA aria-label now contains the visible "Explore more"; BlogSection row + "More articles" aria-labels removed (visible text is the accessible name). (6) **Touch targets** — SiteFooter mailto/tel links gained `py-1` (≥24px). (7) **§6 compliance** — Cloudflare logo removed from the platform marquee (rule 10 avoid-list; SVG kept in `/public/logos`); Sunsill "small-to-medium residential projects"→"residential projects" (rule 9); lexcord `seoTitle` shortened under 60 chars. Remaining owner-side items unchanged (§14.13): GSC sitemap submit/reindex, Apple Business Connect, Bing Places, directory citations, review acquisition. PSI API note: the shared no-key quota 429s — set `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` for real CWV in the audit tool.
- **2026-07-10** — **Phone contact removed from all public surfaces** (owner request). The `phone` field was deleted from `lib/data/business.ts` so TypeScript flags any future consumer. Removed from: SiteFooter tel link, ContactSection tel link ("Or write to us" is now email-only), AboutSection copy ("Email and phone reach us…" → "Email reaches us…"), `ProfessionalService` schema (top-level `telephone` + `ContactPoint.telephone`; the ContactPoint itself stays, email-only), and `llms.txt` (contact line now email-only). §14.1 canonical values now state "Phone: none published"; the NAP contract is Name / Address / Email / ABN. The retired number (+61 410 510 751) appearing anywhere in app/, components/, or lib/ is a truth-auditor block. **Owner-side follow-up:** the Google Business Profile still lists the phone number — decide whether to remove it there too; the site schema no longer emitting `telephone` does not conflict with GBP (absence ≠ mismatch), but citations built later (§14.9) must be created without a phone so NAP stays consistent.
- **2026-08-02** — **Mobile motion restored (selectively) + full PWA installability.** (1) **The site's signature effects were never broken on mobile — they were switched off in code.** Every `<768px` visitor got a plain vertical stack because `StickySection` returned early on `matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)')`, killing all three layered transitions (`parallax` brightness/scale, `mask-diagonal` clipPath reveal, `pixel-glitch` opacity), while its `peekBackground` layer was `hidden md:block` and both `Aurora` instances were gated behind `{!isMobile && …}`. Measured before/after on an iPhone 13 viewport: `<canvas>` count 0 → 2. The transitions now run at every breakpoint (they animate only compositor-friendly properties); the reduced-motion guard is untouched. (2) **Deliberately still desktop-only** — do not "fix" these: the **ServicesSection pinned horizontal rail** (owner decision — a scroll-jacking horizontal pin fights native touch scrolling) and the **ProcessSection SVG connector** (its path is hard-coded to the desktop collage's `viewBox 0 0 400 500` coordinates; mobile uses a clean 2-col grid, so the curve would connect nothing. Note the mobile branch in that effect still animates `pathRef` — dead code against a `hidden` element, harmless). (3) **Aurora** gained an `antialias` prop (MSAA is baked into the GL context at creation, so it is a `useEffect` dep, not a ref read); mobile passes `false` plus lower speed/amplitude. Both call sites now gate render on a **three-state** `viewport` (`'unknown' | 'mobile' | 'desktop'`) rather than a boolean — a boolean defaults to `false` on first paint, which would build a desktop GL context on mobile and immediately tear it down to rebuild. `StickySection`'s own `isMobile` state was deleted as dead code. (4) **PWA**: `public/site.webmanifest` (stale — still said "Digital Alchemy", `theme_color: #eab308` which is not the brand gold, `#000000` background, no `start_url`/`scope`/`id`) replaced by **`app/manifest.ts`**, sourced from `lib/brand.ts` + `lib/data/business.ts`. **`app/layout.tsx` must NOT declare `manifest:`** — the file-based metadata route injects `<link rel="manifest">` itself, and declaring both emits the tag twice. `appleWebApp` added; Next.js emits the standardised `mobile-web-app-capable`, so the legacy `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` is added via `metadata.other` to cover iOS < 16.4. `statusBarStyle: 'black-translucent'` is paired with an inline `env(safe-area-inset-top)` padding on the fixed `Navigation` (inline, not a `pt-*` utility, because Tailwind's emitted `py-*`/`pt-*` order is not guaranteed by class order; resolves to 0 in browser tabs, so zero visual change outside standalone mode). New **`/icon-maskable`** route renders the logo at 280px on opaque brand-black — Android masks to the centre 80% (a 409.6px circle at 512, whose inscribed square is ~290px), and the existing edge-to-edge-on-transparency icon would lose its corners and show the launcher through. (5) **Service worker** (`public/sw.js`, registered by `components/pwa/ServiceWorkerRegistrar.tsx` on `load`, production only) is deliberately conservative because this is an SEO-led site: navigations are **network-first** (a publish is visible immediately), `/_next/static/*` is cache-first (content-hashed, immutable), other same-origin GETs are stale-while-revalidate, and `/api/*` + `/.well-known/*` + cross-origin + non-GET are **never touched** — verified 0 API entries cached. `/offline` is the precached fallback (noindex, absent from sitemap). **Bump `VERSION` in sw.js on any change to it** — `activate` deletes every `pixdyne-*` cache not in the current set. `next.config.ts` serves `/sw.js` with `Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate`. Verified on a production build: manifest/meta/icon correct, SW registered at scope `/`, offline fallback renders for unvisited routes while visited routes still open, `tsc` + `build` green. Chrome's *automatic* install prompt requires the SW fetch handler (menu install has not required one since Chrome 108/112); the only local console 404 is `/_vercel/insights/script.js`, which exists solely on Vercel.
- **2026-08-04** — **App store-compliance surfaces shipped for two unreleased in-house apps** (PixComic, Hao Roomie). Neither app is on the App Store yet; the pages exist so Apple App Review and Google AdMob have reachable policy/support URLs to verify against. Owner instruction was explicitly "don't put them anywhere prominent — reachable and verifiable is enough", so **none of these routes appear in `Navigation`, `SiteFooter`, or `sitemap.ts`**. (1) **`public/app-ads.txt`** now declares `google.com, pub-6330113427891443, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0`. The publisher ID was derived from the owner-supplied AdMob app ID `ca-app-pub-6330113427891443~5011240363` (the digits between `pub-` and `~`); `f08c47fec0942fa0` is Google's fixed IAB TAG certification-authority ID and is identical for every publisher. Verified served at `/app-ads.txt` as `text/plain; charset=UTF-8`. **The store listing's developer-website field must resolve to the apex** — `www` 308s to apex and Google follows it, but the apex avoids a needless hop. (2) **New routes**: `/pixcomic/privacy`, `/pixcomic/support`, `/haoroomie/support`, and `/apps` (a hub listing every app's policy + support links, rendered from the new `lib/data/apps.ts`). `/apps` is the only one carrying `robots: { index: false, follow: true }` — `follow: true` is deliberate so crawlers still reach the policy pages, which must stay reachable for review. The policy/support pages themselves are **not** noindex (they are ordinary legal surfaces, same as `/haoroomie/privacy`); they are simply absent from the sitemap. (3) **`/haoroomie/privacy` keeps its 2026-06-07 effective date** — its policy text is unchanged; only the Chinese translation block was removed (see below). (4) **All four pages are English-only.** *(Superseded for the two PixComic pages on 2026-08-06 — see that entry. `/haoroomie/*` is still English-only.)* They shipped bilingual (English + 简体中文) and the Chinese halves were removed the same day on owner instruction — App Review and AdMob read English, and a second language doubles the surface that has to stay in lockstep with `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` and the store privacy labels. The app's own name (好室友) is retained as a brand string in the page kicker and `lib/data/apps.ts` `altName` — that is a name, not translated content. NAP comes from `lib/data/business.ts` per §14.1. (5) Governance for these surfaces is now §15. Verified: `tsc` + `build` green (86 prerendered pages), all six app routes 200, `/apps` emits `noindex, follow`, canonicals correct, and `grep -cE 'pixcomic|haoroomie|/apps'` against the built sitemap returns **0**.
- **2026-08-06** — **PixComic privacy + support pages resynced from the app repo, and made bilingual (reverses the 2026-08-04 English-only rule).** The live pages had drifted from `docs/website/{privacy,support}.md` in the PixComic repo, and two answers were **wrong**, not merely stale. (1) **Privacy — the AdMob disclosure table went 4 rows → 7** (adds Crash data, Performance data, Other diagnostic data) and **two `tracking` values were narrowed** from "Yes, if you allow it" to "No" (Advertising data, Coarse location). Only the advertising identifier is now declared as tracking. The table is transcribed category-for-category from the privacy manifest inside the Google Mobile Ads SDK — the same source Apple merges into the store privacy label. **This is a three-place change (§15.2 rule 4): web page + `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` + App Store privacy label must agree, and Apple cross-checks them.** Prose added explaining that provenance; the EEA consent wording now states that declining means *no ads are shown at all* (SDK not started), and the tipping wording distinguishes "no further ad requests" from "SDK not initialised from next launch". (2) **Support — two new entries and two corrections.** New: the PIN "pairing code" gate (placed first in the Wi-Fi group because transfers are PIN-protected by default, so it is the first thing most people hit) and "the transfer screen never shows an address" (cellular-only has no reachable address). Corrected: the old answer claimed a suspended transfer "resumes… you never have to start over", which is **not what ships** — the app restarts its own service, but the *browser* retries only 3 times over ~7s then marks the file Failed, so the user must re-drag it (it does resume from the reached byte). Also corrected: the squashed-pages answer named one toggle when three govern it (Landscape spread / Cover as single page / Split wide pages), and the tap-zone path is `Settings → Reader → Tap zones for page turns`. §15.2 rule 5 exists precisely because of this class of error. (3) **Bilingual.** Owner reversed the English-only decision. Both pages now carry a `lang="zh-Hans"` Simplified Chinese section below the English, with a top anchor to it. **The structural safeguard matters more than the translation**: every translated string is a paired `{ en, zh }` object behind a `Localised` type (`FAQ_GROUPS`, `AD_DATA_ROWS`, `TABLE_HEADERS`, `STILL_STUCK`), rendered twice via a `locale` prop — so a half-translated edit fails to compile rather than silently shipping a privacy table whose Chinese half disagrees with the English. That drift is exactly what made the first bilingual attempt a liability on 2026-08-04. §15.2 rule 6 rewritten accordingly; `/haoroomie/*` stays English-only. (4) The support page keeps its `/contact` link, which the source doc omits — it is an internal link with real value and breaks no rule. (5) **Deployed and verified live the same day** (`26619f1`): privacy renders 1×"Yes, if you allow it" + 6×"No" in English and 1×「你允许的话，是」+ 6×「否」in Chinese, both `<time>` values read 2026-08-06, and support no longer contains the false "you never have to start over" string. Note when re-checking with grep: `>No<` anchored in angle brackets matches only the rendered HTML, while an unanchored string also matches Next.js's RSC payload at the foot of the document and double-counts.

  **Follow-up status.** *Tracking values — CLOSED, the page is correct.* Verified against the privacy manifest inside `GoogleMobileAds.xcframework` (**GMA 13.7.0**): `DeviceID` is the only type with `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypeTracking = true`; `AdvertisingData`, `CoarseLocation`, `CrashData`, `OtherDiagnosticData`, `PerformanceData` and `ProductInteraction` are all **false**. **UMP 3.1.0** additionally declares `CoarseLocation` / `PerformanceData` / `ProductInteraction`, all false, which does not change the union. App manifest ∪ GMA ∪ UMP matches our own manifest row for row. So the 4→7-row edit moved the page from **over-reporting to accurate** — the old "Yes" values were the ones disagreeing with Google's declaration. Under-reporting was never the risk. **App Store privacy label must therefore put only Device ID under "Data Used to Track You"; the other six stay out.** *Method note for the next re-verification:* do **not** eyeball `plutil -p | grep -A3 -i tracking` — `Tracking` is the last key in each dict, so the context window spills into the next entry's type name and mispairs every row; parse with `plistlib` and bind per entry instead. A full Privacy Report is GUI-only (`Archive → Organizer → Generate Privacy Report`, not scriptable), but the merge rule is simply "true in any one manifest → true overall", so the table above is what it will show.

  *AdMob consent messages — STILL OPEN, and now externally visible.* Mechanism confirmed: the gate is `canRequestAds` (Google's recommended pattern) and "no message configured" is an **account-level** failure, so no region can fetch a configuration — this is why a non-EEA simulator also served zero ads. **Not a bug, do not "fix" it in code**; once the messages are published, non-EEA users resolve to `notRequired` and ads resume. App side is ready: `presentPrivacyOptionsForm` is wired to Settings → About → Ad privacy options and only waits on Privacy options being enabled in the message; and there is no double ATT prompt, because UMP shows its own explainer before triggering the system prompt while the app's own ATT call fires only on `.notDetermined`. Debug launch arguments now exist for testing (`-PixUMPGeography EEA|other`, `-PixResetAdConsent`; the last is required because UMP caches the first answer, so "decline → re-consent" is otherwise untestable). **Because the page is now live, its promise of an EEA/UK/CH consent form is currently a claim about behaviour that does not yet exist — publishing those two messages is what makes it true.**

- **2026-08-11** — **PixComic pages: all purchase/tip content removed — the app now ships ads-only.** Owner decision, recorded in the app repo (`pixdyne/pixcomicreader` @ `48bb3d1` "Ship ads-only"): the tip jar is deferred to a later release, StoreKit stays compiled in but dormant behind `StoreManager.purchasesEnabled = false`, and there is no ad-removal path. The pages had to follow: support walked users through a **Settings → tip row → Restore purchases** flow that does not exist in the shipping build (§15.2 rule 5 — answers must be traceable to shipped behaviour), and privacy promised "tipping once removes ads permanently", a claim about behaviour that does not ship. (1) **Privacy** — the tipping bullet and the entire "Purchases" section removed from both the English and the `lang="zh-Hans"` halves; `lastUpdatedISO` bumped 2026-08-06 → 2026-08-11. *Trap for the next date bump:* the Chinese「最后更新」line hardcodes its human-readable date (「2026 年 8 月 11 日」) instead of deriving from `lastUpdatedHuman` — it must be changed by hand alongside the constant. **The AdMob disclosure table is untouched, so this is deliberately *not* a three-place change under §15.2 rule 4** — the purchase flow never appeared in `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (StoreKit transactions are Apple's own collection, not declared by the app), so deleting the section removes a reference to a nonexistent flow; the table, manifest and store label still agree. (2) **Support** — the entire Purchases FAQ group (both Q&As) removed from `FAQ_GROUPS`, and the "restoring purchases" / "purchases" clauses trimmed from all three metadata descriptions (top-level, openGraph, twitter). The `{ en, zh }` pairing made the bilingual deletions symmetrical by construction. (3) **When the tip jar ships, do not revert this commit** — that would resurrect the 2026-08-06 wording, which by then may be stale. Resync from the app repo's `docs/website/{privacy,support}.md`, which were scrubbed in the same app-repo commit and will be updated when purchases return. (4) The *AdMob consent messages — STILL OPEN* note above is deliberately untouched — its author asked to close it themselves once handed the on-device test results. Verified: `tsc` + `build` green, both pixcomic routes prerendered, `grep -ci 'tip\|purchas\|打赏\|购买\|supporter'` returns **0** against both built HTML documents, and both `<time>` values render 2026-08-11.

- **2026-10-24** — **Services pages now show past work; TNTS added as a new "Website Visual Upgrade" category** (owner request). (1) **`/services`** keeps its hero, adds one slowly drifting strip of every project, then one full-bleed "chapter" per service, each on its own ground with its own composition (`components/services/ServiceChapter.tsx`: cover / showcase / bento / features / editorial / product). All service copy is unchanged; only arrangement. Scroll motion lives in one client component, `components/services/ServicesMotion.tsx`, driven by `data-*` attributes; copy is never faded out (§14.10) and everything is skipped under reduced motion (§8). (2) **Project choice follows `/work` array order** (owner: the key projects are already first). `getServiceShowcase()` walks the services in page order; each takes its earliest project with a screenshot as lead, then the next ones, never repeating a project across services. Re-ordering `caseStudies` is how to change what the services pages show. (3) **Images are never cropped.** `scripts/image-meta.mjs` (sharp, ships with Next) writes `lib/data/image-meta.json`: each project image's size, whether it is a transparent device mockup (most of `/public/projects`) or a flat screenshot, and the mockup's visible box, so layouts drop the empty transparent margin without cutting a visible pixel. **Re-run it after adding or replacing a project image**; missing entries still render, untrimmed. (4) **TNTS** (`/work/tnts`, approved by owner) is the first "Website Visual Upgrade" project. The owner asked for the old and new site to be compared, so `CaseStudyItem.beforeAfter` pairs render as a drag-to-compare frame (`components/work/BeforeAfter.tsx`) on the project page and in the web development page's visual-upgrade group. The "before" captures are the live store as it was on 2026-10-07. (5) **`/services/[slug]`** opens with that service's lead project; Web Development groups its work as New websites / Online stores & platforms / Website visual upgrade (`WEB_BUILD_GROUPS`; group copy still TBD(owner)). (6) `/services` chapter 06 shows a capture of onlypixai.com (`public/work/onlypixai.webp`), the only image in that chapter.

## 14. SEO Governance

SEO is a brand asset for this site, not a finishing layer. Every public page, schema block, and copy decision must respect these rules. The truth-auditor enforces them; the seo-agent owns them.

### 14.1 NAP Consistency (single source of truth)

Canonical business identity lives in **`lib/data/business.ts`** (`BUSINESS` and `BUSINESS_FORMATTED` exports). Every NAP-bearing surface imports from there — no exceptions, no inline duplicates.

Canonical values:

- **Name:** Pixdyne
- **Address:** 294 Clayton Rd, Clayton VIC 3169, Australia
- **Email:** info@pixdyne.com
- **Phone:** none published. Removed from every public surface (UI, schema, llms.txt) by owner decision 2026-07-10 — see §13. Do not publish any phone number or re-add a `phone` field to `business.ts` without explicit owner approval.
- **ABN:** 96 690 116 584

To change any field, edit `lib/data/business.ts` only. All consumers re-render automatically.

Current consumers (kept here for audit purposes — not for editing):

| Surface | File |
|---|---|
| Organisation schema | `lib/seo/schema.ts` → `generateOrganizationSchema()` |
| Privacy policy | `app/legal/privacy/page.tsx` |
| Terms of service | `app/legal/terms/page.tsx` |
| Site footer | `components/layout/SiteFooter.tsx` |
| Contact page section | `components/sections/ContactSection.tsx` |
| App compliance pages (§15) | `app/apps/page.tsx`, `app/pixcomic/{privacy,support}/page.tsx`, `app/haoroomie/{privacy,support}/page.tsx` |

**No NAP literal may be hardcoded outside `lib/data/business.ts`.** A grep for the address string, email string, or ABN string anywhere else (other than the governance files themselves — this CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md) is a truth-auditor block. The retired phone number (+61 410 510 751 in any format) appearing **anywhere** in app/, components/, or lib/ is likewise a block — it is no longer published at all.

### 14.2 Per-Page Metadata Template (mandatory)

Every new `page.tsx` (static route or `generateMetadata` for dynamic) must export a `Metadata` object with **all** of:

- `title` — ≤ 60 chars. Pattern: `"{Page intent} | Pixdyne"` or `"{Page intent} — {Qualifier}"`. The page's primary cluster keyword (see §14.7) must appear in the title.
- `description` — ≤ 155 chars. One sentence: value proposition + location anchor + canonical service name where applicable.
- `alternates.canonical` — absolute URL `https://pixdyne.com/...`, no trailing slash except root, lowercase.
- `openGraph` — `title`, `description`, `url`. `images` is satisfied either by an explicit `images` entry on the metadata object **or** by an `app/.../opengraph-image.tsx` file co-located with the route (Next.js auto-merges the file-based image into `og:image`). `locale: 'en_AU'` is inherited from root layout.
- `twitter.card` — `'summary_large_image'` when a 1200×630 landscape OG image exists for the page; `'summary'` when only the 1080×1080 square fallback is in use.

Missing any of the above is a truth-auditor failure.

### 14.3 Required Schema by Route

| Route pattern | Required schema | Optional schema |
|---|---|---|
| `/` (root layout) | `ProfessionalService` (LocalBusiness subtype) + `WebSite` | — |
| `/services/[slug]` | `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` (`Product` when `tier === 'product'`) | `FAQPage` when FAQ block exists |
| `/work/[slug]` | `CreativeWork` + `BreadcrumbList` | — |
| `/blog/[slug]` | `Article` + `BreadcrumbList` | — |
| `/blog`, `/work` | (inherits root) | `CollectionPage` / `ItemList` |
| `/legal/*` | (inherits root) | — |

**Never** invent: `aggregateRating`, `review`, additional `sameAs` handles (until verified — GBP URL is confirmed and present), `priceRange` (until owner confirms). `geo` and `openingHoursSpecification` are confirmed and present as of 2026-06-18 — do not alter without owner sign-off.

### 14.4 URL Structure Rules

- kebab-case only — `/services/web-development`, never `/Services/WebDevelopment`
- No trailing slashes except the root `/`
- No query strings inside canonical URLs (filters belong on client-side state, not in canonicals)
- Lowercase throughout
- Stable slugs — once a slug is published, do not rename without a 301 plan

### 14.5 Heading Hierarchy

- Exactly **one** `<h1>` per page, matching the page intent and containing the primary cluster keyword (§14.7) where natural
- `<h2>` for section heads, `<h3>` for subsections — do not skip levels
- Never use heading tags for visual size — use semantic tags styled with CSS

### 14.6 Image SEO

- Use `next/image` (or hand-rolled `<img>` with explicit `width` + `height`) — every image declares dimensions to prevent CLS
- Informative images: descriptive `alt` text (concrete, not "image of …")
- Decorative images: `alt=""`
- Above-the-fold hero image only: `priority` + `fetchPriority="high"`
- Below-the-fold images: implicit lazy-load via `next/image`
- Prefer AVIF / WebP with fallbacks
- Do not ship source images > 2× rendered size

### 14.7 Keyword Framework

Anchor each page to **one** primary cluster keyword. Stuffing is banned.

**Primary clusters** (Melbourne + service intent — the audience actually types these):

- "Melbourne web development" · "web development Melbourne" · "Melbourne web designer"
- "Melbourne IT services" · "Melbourne technology partner" · "long-term technology partner"
- "custom software Melbourne" · "custom system Melbourne" · "bespoke software Australia"
- "ERP implementation Melbourne" · "CRM development Melbourne"
- "managed IT Melbourne" · "ongoing SEO Melbourne"

**Long-tail (platform + location):**

- "Shopify partner Melbourne" · "Shopify developer Melbourne"
- "WordPress developer Melbourne" · "Webflow developer Melbourne"
- "NetSuite consultant Australia" · "NetSuite implementation Melbourne"
- "Salesforce consultant Melbourne" · "HubSpot Melbourne"
- "iOS app developer Melbourne" · "Android app developer Melbourne"

**GEO anchors** (use sparingly, only where genuine):

- "Melbourne" · "Victoria" · "Australia" · "Clayton" · "southeast Melbourne" · "Australian"

**Per service detail page mandate:** the canonical service name (§5) must appear in title + H1 + first paragraph. The primary cluster keyword for that service must appear in title + at least one H2 or first paragraph.

**Forbidden in user-facing copy** (per §6 rules 9 and 10):

- Any size-based audience targeting: "SMB", "small business", "small and medium businesses", "small to medium"
- Engineer-only stack names: Next.js, React, Tailwind, GSAP, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Sentry, Vercel, Cloudflare

**Forbidden everywhere (including schema):**

- "best", "premier", "leading", "world-class", "industry-leading", "trusted by industry leaders"
- "cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art", "next-generation", "revolutionary"

### 14.8 Performance Budgets

| Metric | Target | Action when exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | < 2.5s | Audit hero image weight, preload, font display |
| INP | < 200ms | Profile main thread, defer non-critical JS |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Reserve image / video dimensions, prevent late shifts |
| Total JS (homepage, gz) | < 200 KB | GSAP is heavy — every new animation must justify weight or replace existing JS |
| Total CSS (homepage, gz) | < 40 KB | — |
| FCP | < 1.5s | — |

Slightly relaxed JS budget vs. workspace web/performance.md because this site is animation-led. Animations remain on compositor-friendly properties only (`transform`, `opacity`, `filter`).

### 14.9 Local SEO (Melbourne)

**One-time setup checklist:**

- [x] Google Business Profile claimed at 294 Clayton Rd, Clayton VIC 3169 (done 2026-06-18; URL in `BUSINESS.sameAs`)
- [ ] Apple Business Connect listing claimed (TBD — owner)
- [ ] Bing Places for Business listing claimed (TBD — owner)
- [ ] NAP cited in at least 5 reputable Australian directories. Candidate list: yellowpages.com.au · truelocal.com.au · hotfrog.com.au · startlocal.com.au · localsearch.com.au · auinfo.com
- [ ] Australian Business Register link confirmed (ABN 96 690 116 584)

**Ongoing rules:**

- Schema-level `LocalBusiness` signals are covered by `ProfessionalService` (a subtype). As of 2026-06-18, `geo` (GBP map pin) and `openingHoursSpecification` (Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00) are emitted with owner sign-off, sourced from `lib/data/business.ts`. Adding `priceRange` or `currenciesAccepted` still requires owner sign-off — do not invent.
- Encourage genuine Google reviews. Never fabricate. Do not emit `aggregateRating` until at least 5 verifiable reviews exist.
- For city-targeted blog posts, mention the relevant Melbourne anchor in the H1 or first paragraph (e.g. "Shopify development for Melbourne brands"), never as keyword stuffing.

### 14.10 GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation)

AI search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT search, Gemini) and LLM crawlers favour clear factual statements over animations and marketing fluff. Optimise for being **quotable**.

- About / Services / OnlyPixAI surfaces must include one paragraph of plain prose answering: who Pixdyne is, where, since when, what we do.
- Service detail pages must answer "what is X and what is included" in plain language within the first paragraph (no marketing preamble).
- FAQ blocks (when written) must use `FAQPage` schema and remain factually answerable from page text alone.
- First paint must include the answer. Do not hide core facts behind animation entrances or scroll-triggered reveals.
- Sentences should be short, parseable, declarative. Avoid pronouns that depend on context outside the page.

### 14.11 Content Production (Blog)

- Byline is `Pixdyne Team` (per §6 rule 1 — no individual identities).
- Every post must have a clear, opinionated angle. No "X tips for Y" generic listicles.
- Each post must support at least one primary cluster keyword (§14.7) — title, H1, and at least one H2.
- Internal links: every post links to at least one relevant service detail or another related post.
- Frequency: monthly cadence target once the topic plan is approved (TBD).
- Cite sources where claims are non-obvious. Apply workspace data-integrity principles when the post makes safety-critical or factual claims (see workspace `CLAUDE.md`).

### 14.12 Audit Cadence

| Cadence | Action |
|---|---|
| Per commit | seo-agent + truth-auditor checklists (AGENTS.md §2.2, §2.4) |
| Weekly | GSC error sweep, sitemap freshness, broken-link sweep on top routes |
| Monthly | CWV check across top routes, keyword ranking pulse, GBP review (once claimed) |
| Quarterly | Full schema audit via Google Rich Results Test, competitor positioning review, copy audit against §14.7 |

### 14.13 Open SEO Items (TBD)

- ✅ Google Search Console: verified via DNS TXT (Domain property, apex + www). No `verification.google` meta tag — DNS record is the source of truth. Owner follow-up: submit sitemap + request homepage reindex in GSC to flush the stale title/host from the index.
- ✅ Google Business Profile claimed (2026-06-18). GBP share URL is in `BUSINESS.sameAs`; `geo` + `openingHoursSpecification` (Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00) + `legalName` (Pixdyne Pty Ltd) now emitted in `ProfessionalService` schema.
- `<!-- TBD: Verified `sameAs` social handles — @pixdyne (X) and linkedin.com/company/pixdyne confirmed NOT to exist as of 2026-06-18; add only once created -->`
- `<!-- TBD: Per-service 1200×630 landscape OG images at /og/services/{slug}.jpg — currently fall back to /og-image.png square -->`
- `<!-- TBD: Per-blog 1200×630 OG images at /og/blog/{slug}.jpg — referenced in blog post metadata but not yet produced -->`
- `<!-- TBD: Apple Business Connect + Bing Places listings (GBP already claimed) -->`
- `<!-- TBD: FAQ content per service detail page — unlocks FAQPage schema -->`
- `<!-- TBD: Real client review acquisition strategy — minimum 5 verified reviews before any AggregateRating schema -->`
- `<!-- TBD: Blog topic plan and editorial calendar — drives §14.11 cadence -->`

## 15. App Store-Compliance Surfaces

Pixdyne publishes its own mobile apps. Apple App Review requires a reachable **privacy-policy URL** (and a **support URL** on the store listing); Google AdMob requires **`/app-ads.txt`** at the apex root. Those pages live on this site because it owns the brand domain — but they are **compliance destinations, not marketing pages**, and are governed separately from everything in §14.

### 15.1 Current surfaces

| App | Privacy | Support |
|---|---|---|
| PixComic (iPhone · iPad) | `/pixcomic/privacy` | `/pixcomic/support` |
| Hao Roomie · 好室友 (iPhone · Android) | `/haoroomie/privacy` | `/haoroomie/support` |
| — | `/apps` (hub listing both) | — |

App metadata is registered in **`lib/data/apps.ts`**; `/apps` renders from that array, so adding a third app is a one-entry change plus two new page files.

### 15.2 Hard rules

1. **Never add these routes to `sitemap.ts`, `Navigation`, or `SiteFooter`.** Owner decision 2026-08-04: reachable and verifiable, not prominent. `/apps` is the single internal entry point.
2. **`/apps` is `robots: { index: false, follow: true }`.** `follow: true` is load-bearing — crawlers must still be able to reach the policy pages. The policy and support pages themselves are **not** noindex; they are ordinary legal surfaces.
3. **Do not add App Store / Play Store links until the listings are actually live.** Both apps are unreleased as of 2026-08-04 (§6 rule 8 — visible placeholders over fabricated content).
4. **A privacy page must stay in lockstep with the app's `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` and its App Store privacy nutrition labels.** Apple cross-checks all three; editing one without the others is an App Review rejection. The disclosure tables in `/pixcomic/privacy` are the web copy of those labels — changing a row is a three-place change.
5. **Support-page answers must be traceable to shipped behaviour.** Never write a UI walkthrough ("tap Settings → …") that has not been confirmed against the actual build. An inaccurate support page is worse than a short one. `/haoroomie/support` is deliberately narrow for this reason — every answer restates something already published in `/haoroomie/privacy`.
6. **English first, Simplified Chinese permitted on the PixComic pages.** Supersedes the 2026-08-04 English-only rule (owner reversed it 2026-08-06). English remains the authoritative text — App Review and AdMob read it, and it is what must match `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`. Where a translation exists it must say *exactly* what the English says; a drifting translation of a privacy disclosure is a review risk, not a cosmetic one (rule 4). **Structural requirement:** translated strings must be stored as paired objects (`{ en, zh }`) behind a `Localised` type, never as two parallel arrays or two hand-maintained JSX blocks of body text — the type checker is what makes a half-translated edit fail to compile. English section first, Chinese in a `lang="zh-Hans"` block below it, with an in-page anchor at the top. `/haoroomie/*` stays English-only until the same is explicitly asked for. An app's own name in another script (好室友) is a brand string, not translated content.
7. **NAP comes from `lib/data/business.ts`** like everywhere else (§14.1).
8. **Only `info@pixdyne.com`** (§6 rule 11e). Do not invent a `support@` mailbox for the apps.
9. **External legal links** (Google/Apple policies) are clickable — App Review expects it — but carry `rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"` so link equity does not leak.

### 15.3 app-ads.txt

`public/app-ads.txt` declares authorised sellers for the apps' ad inventory:

```
google.com, pub-6330113427891443, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

- The publisher ID is derived from the AdMob **app ID** `ca-app-pub-6330113427891443~5011240363` — it is the digits between `pub-` and `~`.
- `f08c47fec0942fa0` is Google's fixed IAB TAG certification-authority ID. It is the same for every publisher worldwide. **Never change it.**
- The file must be served from the **apex root**, `https://pixdyne.com/app-ads.txt`. Google reads the developer-website field on the store listing, strips it to the root domain, and fetches from there. `www` 308s to apex and Google follows the redirect, but **declare the apex on the store listing** to avoid the hop.
- One file covers every app under the same AdMob account. Adding an app does not require a new line unless it uses a different publisher or a resale partner.

Verify after any deploy that touches it:

```bash
curl -sI https://pixdyne.com/app-ads.txt   # 200, content-type: text/plain
```
